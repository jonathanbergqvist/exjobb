==17717== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==17717== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==17717== or are doing some strange experiment):
==17717==   /usr/local/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=17717 ...command...
==17717== 
==17717== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==17717==   /path/to/gdb ./InterfaceComparison3
==17717== and then give GDB the following command
==17717==   target remote | /usr/local/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=17717
==17717== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
